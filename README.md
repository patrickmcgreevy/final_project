# final_project
Running this project:
Per an email discussion w/ Dr. Cook (both TA's were CC'ed) this project is unrunnable because the necessary data files are so large that it is untenable to upload them. Did you guys know that git has a max buffer size, because I sure didn't...
In the demo video on the Google Doc, you can see me run "gan_working_real_good.py", then "synth-data-testing.py". The first file isn't run to completion b/c it takes multiple hours, but the second is. The training results of running the first script are shown in the demo video.
If this is problematic or you need more from me, please email me at 'patrick dot mcgreevy at wsu dot edu'
